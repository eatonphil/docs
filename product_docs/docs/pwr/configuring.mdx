## `pwr` configuration file

To reduce the number of command-line arguments needed when executing `pwr`, you can use a configuration file to specify options that always have the same value but with values that differs from the default.

During execution, `pwr` looks for an existing configuration file in `~/.pwr.conf` and `/etc/pwr.conf`, in that order using the first one found,
unless specified using the `--config` option, which overides the default locations.

The installation package creates a template for the configuration file in `/etc/pwr.conf.templ`. We recommend copying this file to one of the
two places where `pwr` looks for a configuration file and editing the options as necessary.

The following sections describe the options you can specify for the configuration file.

### `input_dir`

Identifies an existing directory where the `edb_wait_states` contents of a Lasso report are located. This option is used mainly for `pwr report` execution (see [Using](using)).

### `output_dir`

Specifies where the reports are outputted. During execution, PWR tries to create the directory if it doesn't exist.

### `report_name`

Provides the name of the report files generated. Usually, this option is better used from the command line, given that different reports typically have
different names.

### `log_file`

Provides the full path to the file where `pwr` writes the `stdout` and `stderr` logs.

### `log_level`

Specifies the level to use when running PWR. Valid values are, from more verbose to less verbose: 
    `DEBUG`
    `INFO` (default if not specified)
    `WARNING`
    `ERROR`
    `CRITICAL`

See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) documentation for more information about log levels.

### `log_format`

Provides the format of the log messages that are written to the log file. See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) documentation for more information on log formatting.

### `assets_dir`

Identifies the directory where you can find the jinja templates used to format the HTML output and the CSS used for PDF output. The value you may want to use by default is `/usr/share/pwr/assets`, which contains the assets provided with the `edb-pwr` package.
